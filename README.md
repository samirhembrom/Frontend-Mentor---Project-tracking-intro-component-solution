### What I learned

I find it quite intriguing when different types of animation seems so visually appealing. I learned few ways to give animation and trying to understand more about different animation techniques.

```css
@keyframes scalling {
  0% {
    transform: scale(0, 0.025);
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1, 0.025);
  }
  100% {
    opacity: 1;
  }
}
```
